We only use one thread to autosave the game in the background. JSON is a great format for storing trivial databind
easily represented by strings or primitive data types so I went with that and was already using Jackson for my weather api.
Since Jackson is such a major library, I assumed it would be thread-safe. I googled it to be sure and documentation says it is.
We outright own the thread. Since it's trivial to save, the code is declared via annonymous lambda inline. Instead of starting
the thread upon initialization of the object, we explicitly begin and end the thread via methods. The data is passed into the
thread through immutable means through JSON. We have a slight risk for data races due to the fact that the GameData object is
shared. We only create one Save and one GameData throughout the project (statically defined in a sense) so should be fine as
main thread is usually blocked by the user input. However, the thread is not synced with the main thread still creating this
risk. It still doesn't block the main thread which allows us to autosave in the background. According to the docs I read, the
Jackson components are immutable after instantiated therefore thread safe.
